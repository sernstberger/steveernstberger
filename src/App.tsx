                    I am a Front-End Developer with 14 years of professional
                    experience. I have worked with large enterprise clients like
                    Cummins, Interactive Intelligence, and ExactTarget,
                    start-ups with one employee, and everything in between. I
                    currently work for Vemo Education, where I serve as the Lead
                    Front-End Developer. I enjoy solving problems and creating
                    beautiful interfaces that are easy to use on any device. In
                    my free time I enjoy traveling, watching movies, playing
                    trivia, and drawing.
