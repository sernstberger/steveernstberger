          I am a Front-End Developer with 14 years of professional experience. I
          have worked with large enterprise clients like Cummins, Interactive
          Intelligence, and ExactTarget, start-ups with one employee, and
          everything in between. I currently work for Vemo Education, where I
          serve as the Lead Front-End Developer. I enjoy solving problems and
          creating beautiful interfaces that are easy to use on any device. In
          my free time I enjoy traveling, watching movies, playing trivia, and
          drawing.
